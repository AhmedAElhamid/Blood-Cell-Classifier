# Blood Cell Classifier
## Introduction
The diagnosis of blood-based diseases often involves identifying and characterizing patient blood samples.
Automated methods to detect and classify blood cell subtypes have important medical applications.
so,This project aims to classify blood cell images using CNN

## Dataset
Link : https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/blood-cells

## Description
This dataset contains 12,500 augmented images of blood cells (JPEG) with accompanying cell type labels (CSV). 
There are approximately 3,000 images for each of 4 different cell types grouped into 4 different folders (according to cell type). The cell types are Eosinophil, Lymphocyte, Monocyte, and Neutrophil. 

## Model Performance

This CNN model achieved test accuracy of 99.6%. by using deep convolution network with residual connections to improve the performance.
